A detailed explanation of your project. This must include:
Problem Statement: Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising technology in biorefinery design, capable of converting wet
biomass feedstocks into valuable products like biocrude oil. However, the process involves complex reaction

mechanisms, and characterizing the quantity and quality of HTL products requires time-consuming and cost-
intensive experiments. Machine learning (ML) offers a powerful alternative by learning from existing datasets

and enabling accurate prediction of HTL outcomes based on biomass composition and reaction conditions.
Your task is to develop a machine learning model to predict the yield and quality of hydrothermal liquefaction
(HTL) products, focusing on biocrude oil, by leveraging a provided dataset compiled from experimental
literature. The dataset contains biomass feedstock compositions, reaction conditions, and corresponding HTL
product characteristics.
The dataset is designed to assist you in building a machine learning model that can:
1. Predict HTL product yield and quality.
2. Optimize reaction conditions
   
Input and Output Variables: Inputs: type, temp, time, pressure, % comp. Outputs: Oil yield, Syngas yield, Content

Machine Learning Algorithm(s):  Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and Extra Trees all used since this data is a mix of numerical and categorical values.

Ethics Considerations: Include a link to your completed DataCards and Deon checklist to ensure ethical practices were followed. Did not have time to make these, assuming Professor Okolie obtained this data ethically.
